bandit_parameter: in restless bandits, standard deviation of the noise distribution added to the reward between trials
choice: zero indexed choice of the agent
reward: obtained reward (mean centered)
value: state value estimate of the agent
p_rew_1 - p_rew_N_ACTION: respective rewards for actions (not mean centered)
softmax_1 - softmax_N_ACTION: respective softmax probabilities for actions 
rnn_state_1 - rnn_state_N_HIDDEN: hidden unit actitivity (including noise for noisy agents)
added_noise_rnn_state_1 - added_noise_rnn_state_N_HIDDEN: noise added to hidden units
entropy_loss_weight: entropy loss weight in the loss function
value_loss_weight: value loss weight in the loss function
accuracy: binary indicator whether action with highest reward was chosen
is_switch: binary indicitor whether current choice is different than previous choice
